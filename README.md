# Chat Application
This is a school assignment in which I am learning how to use Node, Heroku, and socket.io to create an interactive chat application.

## Build
* [socket.io](https://socket.io/) - Enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS compiler
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - An asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime designed to build scalable network applications
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) - Cloud Application Platform
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) - JavaScript development tool

## Getting Started
Via Heroku: [ChatApp](https://jb-socialapp.herokuapp.com/)

or 

Via command line:
```
$git clone https://github.com/jobaile/Baile_J_ChatApplication.git
$npm install
$npm start
```
Run in your localhost:3000
