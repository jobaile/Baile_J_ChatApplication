# Chat Application
This is a school assignment in which I am learning how to use Node, Heroku, and socket.io to create an interactive chat application.

**Build**
* [socket.io](https://socket.io/) - Enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) - CSS compiler
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - An asynchronous event driven JavaScript runtime designed to build scalable network applications
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) - Cloud Application Platform
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) - JavaScript development tool

**Getting Started**<br />
Via command line:
```
$npm install

$npm start

```
Run in your localhost:3000

**Installation**
* Node.js
* SASS
* Gulp
* Npm
